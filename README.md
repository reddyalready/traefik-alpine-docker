# Traefik on Alpine (Docker)

Simple Dockerfile that will obtain the latest version of the official traefik binary and run it using Docker compose on an Alpine Linux image for easy extensibility. It has been adapted from the official traefik sources over at https://github.com/containous/traefik

## Running

Want it running already?? Make it so!

After installing docker-compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
